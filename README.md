# Preserving Modules for the Currently Running Kernel when Upgrading under ArchLinux
Or: How to fix one of the most pesky nuissances about arch.

# Warning: Very WIPpy
The `preservemods` script goes into `/usr/local/sbin/`, the two `.hook` files into `/etc/pacman.d/hooks`, or anywhere else, I'm not your mom.

The grand idea is that I try this for a while, maybe receive a few comments, and if it works out well I'll make an aur package or similar.
